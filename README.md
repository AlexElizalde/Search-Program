# Search-Program
The program uses breadth-first or depth-first style search to look through a grid for gold. This program was a an assignment for Symbolic Processing, CSCE 3210.

I used clisp but you can use any other lisp program that you want. Lispworks
and CCL are other options. Best runs on Emacs and on a GNU/Linux distro!

# Search-Program
The program uses breadth-first search to look through a grid for gold. Depth-first and Cost-first search don't work now. This program was a an assignment for Symbolic Processing, CSCE 3210.

I used clisp but you can use any other lisp program that you want. Lispworks
and CCL are other options. Probably doesn't matter but this was tested on Ubuntu GNU/Linux.
